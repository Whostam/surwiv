# Survev.io
Survev.io is a community-driven recreation of the original surviv.io battle royale. The project aims to preserve the classic experience by rebuilding the final pre-acquisition version of the game with open source tools.

For setup instructions, hosting details, and contribution guidelines, check the documentation in this repository (for example, [HOSTING.md](./HOSTING.md) and files within the `server/` and `client/` folders).
